# Kilonova-Lightcurve-Code
A code for generating Kilonova Lightcurves

This code is primaraly a very basic modification of the code [https://github.com/hotokezaka/HeatingRate][Heating Rate] code of hotokezaka for the paper [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab6a98][Radioactive Heating Rate of r-process Elements and Macronova Light Curve]
